                I am a Memphis-born, Cleveland-raised aspiring full stack developer. Growing up in Cleveland Heights, I attended school through the CHUH school system. I am the youngest of 5, which includes my two half brothers.
                I've always gravitated to technology since I was a child, the biggest medium being video games. Naturally, like any respectable gamer, I've dreamed of making my own game for a long time now. This is a passion project that I hope to complete, but coding has opened my eyes to the world of possibilities available to me.
